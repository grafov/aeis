;;; Usage:

;; Simple rules are:
;;
;; - place your extensions to 'site-lisp' with `autoload'
;; - place init-scripts calling these extensions to 'init-d'

;;; Commentary:


;;; Code:

;; Set load path
(let ((default-directory user-emacs-directory))
  (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '("" "site-lisp"))
  (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))

;; Load scripts from init-d
(require 'init-d)
(init-d)

;; Provide rest of customization
(require 'init-locale)
(require 'init-keybindings)

;; Variables configured via UI
(setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))
(load custom-file)

(provide 'init)
